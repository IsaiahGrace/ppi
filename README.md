# Platform profile indicator (PPI)
My new X1 laptop has a special file in `/sys/firmware/acpi/` that shows the power profile for the laptop. The three possible options, and their keyboard shortcuts, are:
1. low-power (Fn + l)
2. balanced (Fn + m)
3. performance (Fn + h)
I would like to recieve a notification through GNOME when this file changes. Then hopefully I'll remember to change it more
